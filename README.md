# viral_coinfections

The human respiratory tract hosts a community of viruses that cause epidemics and pandemics. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Influenza are two significant contributors to respiratory infections. We sought to characterize the mechanism of RSV-IAV interactions by analyzing bulk transcriptomics data from experimental conditions of air-liquid interface cell cultures representing the human respiratory tract.
